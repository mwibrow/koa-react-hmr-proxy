# koa-react-hmr-proxy

Simple example of proxying webpack's hot-module-reloading with
[React](https://reactjs.org/) using [Koa](https://koajs.com/).

## Usage

After `npm i` run `npm run watch` and point a browser to `localhost:8080`.

The hot-module-reloading server will be running `localhost:8088` and is
currently set up to serve all (versioned) static content.
